/*
  Catch Errors Handler
  Reference: https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Node
  With async/await, you need some way to catch errors
  Instead of using try{} catch(e) {} in each controller, we wrap the function in
  catchErrors(), catch any errors they throw, and pass it along to our express middleware with next()
*/

export const catchErrors = fn => {
  return function(req, res, next) {
    return fn(req, res, next).catch(next);
  };
};
